# Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forests
This task focuses on understanding and applying tree-based machine learning models for classification and regression problems. Decision Trees are intuitive models that split data based on feature values to make predictions. However, they can easily overfit the training data, so controlling tree depth and complexity is crucial.
